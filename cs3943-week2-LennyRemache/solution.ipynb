    "`CustNum`, `Amount.Requested`,\t`Amount.Funded.By.Investors`,\t`Interest.Rate`,\t`Loan.Length`,\t`Loan.Purpose`,\t`Debt.To.Income.Ratio`,\t`State`,\t`Home.Ownership`,\t`Monthly.Income`,\t`FICO.Range`,\t`Open.CREDIT.Lines`,\t`Revolving.CREDIT.Balance`,\t`Inquiries.in.the.Last.6.Months`, and\t`Employment.Length`. \n",

    "These fields contain data of type `int`, `float`, and `string`, and you are also provided a file named **loans_data_columns.csv** in the repository containing all the column names for easy reference.  Answer the following questions using Linux/Unix bash commands. All questions can be answered in one line (sometimes, with pipes)! Some questions will have many possible solutions. In jupter notebooks, you must prefix all shell commands with an exclamation point, i.e. `!command argument(s)` in order to execute the commands. As an example, to output the contents of a file named **file1.txt** followed by the contents of a file named **file2.txt**, you could execute the following command in the shell:\n",
